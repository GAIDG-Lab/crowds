# Crowd Simulator

An implementation of the Social Forces crowd simulation (it may or may not be correct). There is currently no environment detection. The current implementation is in PhysX. We plan to support more methods in the future, as well as more crowd simulators.  Contributions are welcome.

To use: 

- Load Extension
- Enter desired number of agents (should be a square number)
- Create two Xforms or prims in the World stage with names "Goal1" and "Goal2"
- Run the "Play" button to see simulation
